Version 1.2.1

A lot of important changes in this version 1.2.1 compared to 1.0.7.

- Replaced the old pageable list with a draggable list.  You can now touch, drag, and throw it for both Favorites and Search results.

- Music files now try to cache your phone’s SD Card instead of the phone itself.

- Made input text fields for both the authorization code and search easier to touch and larger fonts.

- You can now press the back key on the Search to abort a search if it’s load, and on your Search Results to search again.  This removes the back button, and gives 
you more visual room.

- You can now press the back button on the authorization code submission form if you made a mistake, or your phone’s currently not connected to the internet.

- Removed the landscape GUI.

- The GUI should now size to different phone sizes.

- Various bug fixes.
