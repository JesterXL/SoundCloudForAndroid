[![Flattr this](http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png)](http://flattr.com/thing/2773/Soundcloud-AS3-API)

This project offers an easy to use AS3 wrapper for the Soundcloud API
http://soundcloud.com/api

See the github wiki for documentation and how to get started:
http://wiki.github.com/dasflash/Soundcloud-AS3-API

It is published as a Library Project for Flash Builder. If you want
to use it with a different editor you can do so by simply checking out
the content of the /src and /lib directories into the class path of
your project or by downloading the SWC from the /bin folder and putting
it into your library path.

Soundcloud AS3 API uses Iotashan's OAuth library (source is included)
http://code.google.com/p/oauth-as3/
which uses the as3crypto library (included as a SWC in the library)
http://code.google.com/p/as3crypto/

JSON decoding is done by the Adobe AS3 core library (also included as
a SWC in the lib)
http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/
